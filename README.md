# WEB-Project-E-Race





This repository contains the files required for my senior design project.

The WEB/E-race is the write-erace board machine that me and a group of 5 other mechnaical engineers at UCLA designed for our senior
design project. This repository contains all the final files required to recreate our project.

More information about program files can be found inside the directories.
